# Magic Healing Garden

Welcome to my Magic Healing Garden â€” a space for gentle transformation, rooted in nature, presence, and the bodyâ€™s wisdom.

This site is a simple one-page introduction to my healing practice, which integrates Chinese Medicine, Zen Shiatsu, Chi Nei Tsang, Theta Healing, flower essences, and trauma-informed care. I studied alchemical healing with Lorie Dechar, and my approach centers on perception shifts, soul restoration, and remembering the deep intelligence within us.

Sometimes true magic is just a change in perception.  
Thatâ€™s the kind of magic I deal in.
