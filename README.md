## Welcome to my Magic Healing Garden.
This is a quiet space for healing, reflection, and support. My work draws from nature, the bodyâ€™s wisdom, and the principles of alchemical healing, which I studied through a year-long mentorship with Lorie Dechar. I weave together tools from Zen Shiatsu, Asian bodywork, Chi Nei Tsang, Theta Healing, and trauma-informed care to support transformation at every level â€” physical, emotional, and energetic. Alchemy, to me, is about turning the lead of our stuck or painful places into gold â€” something luminous, truthful, and alive.

Sometimes true magic is just a change in perception.
Thatâ€™s the kind of magic I deal in.

If something here speaks to you, you're warmly invited to reach out.
