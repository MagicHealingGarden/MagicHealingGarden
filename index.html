    <h1>Welcome to my Magic Healing Garden</h1>
    <p>This is a quiet space for healing, reflection, and support. Trained in Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, I weave together tools from Zen Shiatsu, Asian bodywork, Chi Nei Tsang, Theta Healing, trauma-informed care — plus flower essences, essential oils, and homeopathy — to support transformation at every level: physical, emotional, and energetic. My work is also deeply inspired by nature, the body’s wisdom, and the principles of alchemical healing, which I studied through a year-long mentorship with Lorie Dechar.</p>
    
    <p>Alchemy, to me, is about turning the lead of our stuck or painful places into gold — something luminous, truthful, and alive.</p>

    <em>Sometimes true magic is just a change in perception.</em>
    <p>That’s the kind of magic I work with.</p>

    <p>If something here speaks to you, you’re warmly invited to reach out for a one-on-one healing session — a space where we gently explore whatever is ready to shift, soften, or transform.</p>
